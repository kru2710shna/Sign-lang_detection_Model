# Real-Time Sign Language Detection with TensorFlow Object Detection and Python

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a real-time sign language detection system using TensorFlow Object Detection and Python. Sign language is a crucial means of communication for individuals with hearing impairments, and automating its interpretation can enhance accessibility and communication.

## Features

- **Real-Time Detection:** The system provides real-time sign language detection using live video feeds, allowing users to communicate seamlessly.

- **TensorFlow Object Detection:** Leveraging the power of TensorFlow, the project utilizes pre-trained models for object detection, enabling accurate and efficient recognition of sign language gestures.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** The application offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface, making it accessible to individuals with varying technical expertise.

- **Customizable and Extensible:** Users have the flexibility to customize and extend the system by training their own models with specific sign language gestures.

## Technologies Used

- **TensorFlow:** A powerful open-source machine learning framework, TensorFlow is employed for building and deploying the object detection models.

- **Python:** The project is developed using Python, a versatile programming language known for its readability and ease of use.

- **OpenCV:** OpenCV is utilized for capturing video frames from the webcam and performing image processing tasks.
